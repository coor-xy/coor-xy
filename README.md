# Coor|xy

## About:

Coorxy is a web application that dramatically simplifies the data visualization workflow of tabular data. With an intuitive UI built using React, Redux, and Recharts, users can create beautiful charts and graphs in just a few clicks. Our backend, built using Node, Express, and PostgreSQL, allows users to efficiently store their data and chart customizations to revisit and edit visualizations they have made. The team achieved a fun and low-stress development phase by leveraging agile methodologies and frequent brainstorming sessions. In retrospect, delving deeper into the technologies we learned during Full Stack Academy and exploring new tech was our favorite part of building Coorxy.
